# `/learning`

My evergreen scratchpad of what I'm learning.

## What is it?

This is a monorepo of sorts, where each folder represents a new language, framework, or tool I'm learning. It could be a project, or it could be a single file.

## Why keep it here, in a monorepo?

1. Iâ€™m part of Gen Z, which means I like numbers on my silly little contrib graph ðŸ˜‹
2. To that point, I prefer [Learning in Public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/)
3. **Living notebook > stale repos**: not every tool you pick up you want to make a project with. This format enables a low-commitment, freeform playground without succumbing to `abandoned side project` status.
